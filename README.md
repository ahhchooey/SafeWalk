# [SafeWalk](https://safewalker.herokuapp.com)

Welcome to SafeWalk.

SafeWalk is a map based application that creates routes based on levels of crime. Based on a users starting location, and a selected destination, SafeWalk will generate a walking route to get from point A to point B based on past levels of crime and physical distance. SafeWalk operates on a node graph that holds information on the location and cost to travel between each node. A variation of Dijkstra's algorithm will be used to calculate optimal paths and Mapbox will be used create the map and an interactive application.

Built on MongoDB, Express v4.17.1, React v16.9.0, and Node v12.10.0
